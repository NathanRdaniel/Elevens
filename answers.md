1. List all possible plays for the board 5♠ 4♥ 2♦ 6♣ A♠ J♥ K♦ 5♣ 2♠
5♣,6♣
2. If the deck is empty and the board has three cards left, must they be J, Q, and K? Why or why not? 
yes you cant use any other 3 pair, and if it is then you loose.
3. Does the game involve any strategy? That is, when more than one play is possible, does it matter which one is chosen? Briefly explain your answer. i thnink its 50 / 50 luck and strat becuase theres chances of a loosing hand is just as likely.
